# TelConnect-s-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project predicts churn for TelConnect using machine learning, identifying **contract type, tenure, and payment method** as key drivers. AdaBoost was the best model. A **proactive retention strategy** with targeted incentives and A/B testing is recommended to reduce churn and optimize retention costs.
